# Alien Invasion 2024

Alien Invasion 2024 is a 2D space shooter where the player has to defend earth from alien invaders. It is a clone of Space Invaders and the debut game of Starforge Games, a non-commercial organization of hobby enthusiasts with the drive to make games in their spare time.

The game is entirely implemented using Godot 4 and utilizes a component-based game architecture. The game was originally implemented with a custom game engine written in C#. The original version can be found on [GitHub here](https://github.com/StarforgeGames/Alien-Invasion).
